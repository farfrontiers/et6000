To compile the sources you need Microsoft Driver Development Kit (DDK). Using
the Win2000 DDK you can compile Win2000 ET6x00 graphics driver. Using the WinXP
DDK you can compile both Win2000 and WinXP ET6x00 graphics driver.

ET6x00 Windows graphics driver consists of two binaries - a video miniport
(et6000.dll) and a display (et6000.sys) driver.

ATTENTION!
Before compiling both binaries you need to set the WINXP macros properly
(they are defined in the display\driver.h and miniport\driver.h files).
